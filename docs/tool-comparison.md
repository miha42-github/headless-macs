## Ollama

**Strengths**
- Easiest model management — `ollama pull`, `ollama list`, `ollama run`
- Large model registry with quantised variants
- MLX backend on Apple Silicon since Ollama 0.19 (March 2026) — narrows speed gap with pure MLX tools
- Modelfile system bakes `num_ctx` and sampling parameters into model metadata — the only
  way clients see the correct context window (see `docs/modelfile-guide.md`)
- Most mature and widely tested option

**Weaknesses**
- VS Code Copilot agent mode is broken for local GGUF models — tool call loop bug
  (microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat #3566). Use Zoo Code for agentic tasks.
- Basic tool-call support — no auto-recovery on malformed output (mitigated by Modelfile tuning)
- `num_ctx` must be set via Modelfile, not the UI — Ollama UI override does not update
  the metadata that clients read

**When to choose Ollama**
- You want to get started quickly
- You need to manage many different models via a registry
- You're serving GGUF models with controlled context windows (Modelfile required)
- You're running general-purpose workloads with Zoo Code or Opilot as the client

## Rapid-MLX

Rapid-MLX is a production-grade MLX-based inference server built specifically for Apple Silicon. It reimplements the serving stack with continuous batching, optimised prefill chunking, DeltaNet state snapshots, 17 tool-call format parsers with auto-recovery, and reasoning/content separation for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1.

**Previously benchmarked at 2–4.2× faster than Ollama.** Since Ollama 0.19 adopted the MLX
backend on Apple Silicon (March 2026), the raw generation speed gap has narrowed to ~15–30%.
Rapid-MLX retains meaningful advantages in serving sophistication over Ollama 0.19.

**Strengths**
- Fastest generation on Apple Silicon
- DeltaNet prompt caching — works for hybrid RNN-attention models (Mamba, Jamba) that Ollama and mlx-lm cannot cache
- 17 tool-call parsers with auto-recovery on malformed output — critical for coding agent reliability
- Reasoning separation for Qwen3 / DeepSeek-R1 (`--no-thinking` flag strips reasoning tokens)
- `rapid-mlx doctor` built-in self-diagnostic
- `--prefill-step-size 8192` fixes slow cold-start on long prompts

**Weaknesses**
- Beta (v0.6, April 2026) — not yet suitable as your only option in critical production
- Model aliases (`rapid-mlx models`) don't cover every HF model — use mlx-lm for those
- First `serve` downloads the model — API unavailable until download completes
- Vision/audio require extras: `pip install 'rapid-mlx[vision]'`

**When to choose Rapid-MLX**
- Primary use case is a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Continue)
- You need reliable tool calling
- Generation speed is the priority
- You're running Qwen3 or DeepSeek-R1 and want reasoning separation

**Rapid-MLX vs mlx-lm**
Use Rapid-MLX as the default. Fall back to raw mlx-lm only when you need a specific HuggingFace model path not covered by Rapid-MLX's model aliases.

## mlx-lm

Apple's own ML framework serving layer. Provides an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server for HuggingFace models.

**Strengths**
- Direct HuggingFace model path support — any `mlx-community/` quantised model
- Minimal dependency surface
- Official Apple framework

**Weaknesses**
- Lower-level than Rapid-MLX — no prompt caching, no tool-call recovery, no reasoning separation
- Requires downloading the model before the server can start (plist is written but not bootstrapped if `default_model` is empty)
- No built-in diagnostics

**When to choose mlx-lm**
- You need a specific HuggingFace model not aliased in Rapid-MLX
- You want minimal dependencies
- You're experimenting with Apple's MLX framework directly

**Important:** MLX models do not respect Modelfile `num_ctx`. The context window is fixed
at model conversion time. If clients need to see a specific context window via model
metadata, use GGUF + Ollama instead.

## Infinity

Production-grade embedding and reranking server. Uses MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for GPU-accelerated inference on Apple Silicon.

**Key endpoints**
- `POST http://host:7997/v1/embeddings` — OpenAI-compatible embedding
- `POST http://host:7997/v1/rerank` — Cross-encoder reranking
- `GET  http://host:7997/v1/models` — List loaded models

**Strengths**
- MPS-accelerated — significantly faster than CPU-only embedding servers
- OpenAI-compatible — drop-in for `openai.Embedding.create()`
- Supports both embeddings and reranking from a single server
- High throughput for RAG pipelines

**Weaknesses**
- Embedding-only — not a generation server
- Requires `--device mps` flag (set in plist — handled automatically by `install-tools.sh`)
- Without `--device mps`, falls back to CPU at ~10× lower throughput

**When to choose Infinity**
- Any RAG pipeline — pairs with Ollama or Rapid-MLX for generation
- When you need reranking (cross-encoder) in addition to embeddings
- When embedding throughput matters at scale

## Exo

Clusters multiple Apple Silicon Macs into a single distributed inference node. Pools unified memory across devices to run models larger than any single machine can hold.

**Strengths**
- Run 405B models across 3× Mac Mini M4 64GB (pooling 192GB)
- Tailscale discovery works across networks (not just LAN)
- OpenAI-compatible API

**Weaknesses**
- Runs as LaunchAgent (user-level), not LaunchDaemon — requires auto-login for headless boot
- Each node must have Exo installed and running
- Beta — less tested than single-node options
- Bonjour discovery limited to LAN; Tailscale recommended for production

**When to choose Exo**
- You have multiple Apple Silicon Macs you want to use as a cluster
- The model you need is larger than any single machine's unified memory
- You're comfortable with a more complex setup

**Requirements**
- Auto-login configured on every node (`sysadminctl -autologin set`)
- Tailscale installed and running on all nodes (for cross-network discovery)
- Same Exo version on all nodes
